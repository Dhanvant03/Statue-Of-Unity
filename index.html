                            <p>The statue has been built as an ode to the Iron Man of India, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the first home minister of independent India. He was responsible for uniting all 562 princely states of the country to build the Republic of India.</p>
                            <h3>About Place</h3>
                            <p>October 31st, 2018, marked the inauguration of the world's tallest statue - the Statue of Unity, against the backdrop of the dramatic Satpura and Vindhyachal hills in Kevadia, Gujarat. The 182-metre (600 feet aprox.) statue is dedicated to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the architect of independent India. The colossal monument towers over River Narmada, a tribute to India 'from the people of Gujarat' to the leader who placed people's welfare first. The Statue of Unity overlooks the vast surrounds and the river basin of the Narmada River and the sprawling Sardar Sarovar dam. It stands on the Sadhu Bet hillock, connected by a 300-metre bridge, which offers access from the mainland to the statue.</p>

                            <p>Since time immemorial, architecture and monuments have given India her identity. From historical Ajanta & Ellora caves to Delwara Temple of Mount Abu and from Taj Mahal to Meenakshi Temple of Madurai, Indian architecture showcases its elegance and superiority across the globe. The most prolific creation in recent times, the Statue of Unity, is the World's Tallest Monument. It represents more than a colossal structure facing the Sardar Sarovar Dam on the river Narmada. It is an iconic symbol of the 'Iron Man', who played an important role during India's freedom struggle and thereafter in the unification of the princely states. It reminds the world of the towering personality of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the nucleus of India's integration as a united country.</p>
                            <p>It was the wit and whip of this 'Iron Man' that 562 small and big princely states unanimously agreed to become an integral part of India. The elucidation of the Statue directly correlates with the meaning and value of unity. While, it is one of the finest interpretations of the designers with its modern construal, it also symbolises and describes the quintessence of the statue to visitors. The world's tallest statue is an engineering marvel that was constructed in merely 46 months.</p>
                            <p>Sardar Patel, respected for his commitment and drive, took up the challenge of convincing all the princely states using diplomacy and peaceful means, or the iron hand when needed.</p>
                            <p>The impressive landmark commemorating Sardar Patel's contribution to unification dovetails into several social development programmes such as improved transport and connectivity, institutions of research, education and tribal development, tourist facilities and other social infrastructure.</p>
